# Python_Project_3
Project 3 creates two dendrograms out of DNA and amino acid sequences of the PolA genes of 13 different bacterial species.

The FASTA files for the DNA and protein sequences must be uploaded to the Jupyter notebook for the code to be able to run.

Information on the FASTA files: The FASTA files were taken from NCBI for 13 bacterial species' PolA genes. The amino acid FASTA files were converted into amino acids from the DNA FASTA files using https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/translate.html and the resulting AA sequence was converted into a FASTA file using http://www.sing-group.org/ALTER/.

The output of this code is two phylogenetic trees, or dendrograms, of the DNA and amino acid sequences of the PolA genes of the bacteria.
